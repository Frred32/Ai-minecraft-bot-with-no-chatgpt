Project Overview
I created a Minecraft bot that can move around and chat. It works, but it could definitely use some improvements! Feel free to revamp it if you want to.

Dependencies

mineflayer: This helps build the bot.
mineflayer-pathfinder: Lets the bot find its way around.
gpt4free.js: Enables the bot to chat using AI without needing an API key. I made this without the ChatGPT API, using https://github.com/zachey01/gpt4free.js

Features

Memory: The bot can remember things for better conversations.
Pathfinding: It can navigate tricky areas.
Follow Feature: When you ask the bot to follow you, it will!
